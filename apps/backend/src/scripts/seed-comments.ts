    implication:
      'Ongoing water intrusion causes mould growth, structural wood decay, and damage to finishes.',
    recommendation:
      'Repair or replace the leaking fitting, valve, or pipe section immediately. A licensed plumber should evaluate the full extent of any water damage.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Plumbing',
    title: 'Galvanized Steel Piping',
    condition:
      'Portions of the water supply system consist of galvanized steel pipe, typically identifiable by gray/zinc-coated threads at joints.',
    implication:
      'Galvanized pipe corrodes from the inside out over time, restricting flow, reducing water pressure, and eventually failing or leaking.',
    recommendation:
      'Plan to replace galvanized sections with copper or cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) tubing. Prioritize areas showing discolouration at fixtures.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Plumbing',
    title: 'S-Trap Present',
    condition:
      'A plumbing drain uses an S-trap configuration rather than a code-compliant P-trap and vent.',
    implication:
      'S-traps can lose their water seal through siphoning, allowing sewer gases including hydrogen sulphide and methane to enter the living space.',
    recommendation:
      'Have a licensed plumber replace the S-trap with a properly vented P-trap assembly in accordance with Ontario Building Code.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Plumbing',
    title: 'Polybutylene (PB) Piping',
    condition:
      'Supply piping is grey polybutylene plastic, identifiable by the "PB2110" stamp on the pipe.',
    implication:
      'Polybutylene is known to fail unexpectedly at fittings, causing significant water damage with little advance warning.',
    recommendation:
      'Replace all polybutylene supply piping with copper or PEX. Contact your insurer, as coverage may be restricted for PB systems.',
  },
  // ── Roofing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    category: 'Roofing',
    title: 'Granular Loss on Shingles',
    condition:
      'Significant granular loss is visible on asphalt shingles, with bare asphalt substrate exposed in multiple areas.',
    implication:
      'Granules protect the asphalt from UV degradation. Extensive loss indicates shingles are near end of service life and water infiltration may follow.',
    recommendation:
      'Have a qualified roofing contractor perform a full assessment. Budget for roof replacement within the near term.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Roofing',
    title: 'Lifted or Buckling Shingles',
    condition: 'Multiple shingles are lifting at edges or buckling mid-panel over a defined area.',
    implication:
      'Lifted shingles allow wind-driven rain to enter beneath the shingle layer, leading to sheathing rot and interior leaks.',
    recommendation:
      'A qualified roofing contractor should re-nail and re-seal affected shingles or replace them. Address underlying ventilation or installation issues.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Roofing',
    title: 'Damaged or Missing Flashing',
    condition:
      'Metal flashing at chimneys, skylights, valleys, or wall-to-roof junctions is corroded, bent, improperly sealed, or absent.',
    implication:
      'Flashing failures are a primary cause of roof-related water infiltration into the structure and insulation.',
    recommendation:
      'Have damaged or missing flashing repaired or replaced by a qualified roofing contractor. Apply appropriate sealant where specified.',
  },
  // ── Structure ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    category: 'Structure',
    title: 'Notched or Bored Joist',
    condition:
      'A floor or ceiling joist has been notched or bored in the tension zone (middle third of span), reducing its structural cross-section.',
    implication:
      'Structural notching outside code-permitted zones weakens the joist and can lead to excessive deflection or failure under load.',
    recommendation:
      'Have a structural engineer or qualified contractor assess the degree of modification and prescribe a repair such as sistering the joist.',
  },
  // ── HVAC ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    category: 'HVAC',
    title: 'Furnace Heat Exchanger – Signs of Cracking',
    condition:
      'Visible stress cracks or rust pitting are observed on the heat exchanger surfaces, or the burners show abnormal flame rollout.',
    implication:

  },
  // ── Basement ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    category: 'Basement',
    title: 'Evidence of Water Infiltration',
    condition:
      'Efflorescence, staining, or high moisture readings are present on basement foundation walls or floor slab.',
    implication:
      'Chronic moisture infiltration promotes mould growth, degrades concrete, and can indicate hydrostatic pressure issues that worsen over time.',
    recommendation:
      'Improve exterior grading and downspout extensions first. If moisture persists, consult a waterproofing specialist for interior or exterior membrane solutions.',
  },
  // ── Safety ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  {
    category: 'Safety',
    title: 'Missing or Inoperative Smoke Alarm',
    condition:
      'A required smoke alarm is absent from a sleeping area, floor level, or adjacent hallway, or the installed unit did not respond to test activation.',
    implication:
      'Non-compliant smoke alarm coverage violates the Ontario Fire Code and significantly increases the risk of injury in the event of a fire.',
    recommendation:
      'Install code-compliant smoke alarms on every storey and outside each sleeping area. Test all units after installation.',
  },
  {
    category: 'Safety',
    title: 'Missing Carbon Monoxide Alarm',
    condition:
      'No carbon monoxide alarm is present within 5 metres of each sleeping area in a dwelling that contains a fuel-burning appliance or attached garage.',
    implication:
      'Absence of CO alarms is a violation of the Ontario Fire Code (O. Reg. 213/07) and leaves occupants with no warning of CO accumulation.',
    recommendation:
      'Install ULC-listed CO alarms adjacent to each sleeping area and on each storey. Test after installation and replace per manufacturer schedule.',
